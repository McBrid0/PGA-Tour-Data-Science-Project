This repository contains jupyter notebooks related to multiple data science projects completed using the PGA tour dataset I created. Please read the file descriptions below.

1. PGAtour.com Web Scraper - Contains code used to scrape the pgatour.com website for PGA tour player statistics from 2007-2017.
2. pgatour_raw.db - Sqlite database file containing pgatour player data scraped in file 1.
3. PGA Tour Data Science Project-Final.ipynb - Contains a machine learning project focused on classifying players as tournament and non-tournament winners. 

More files will be added to this repository as I continue to develop more project ideas associated with this dataset.
